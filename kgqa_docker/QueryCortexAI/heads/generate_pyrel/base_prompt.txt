**Task Description:**  
You need to translate provided intermediate representations (IR) of a natural language query into an executable query in a query language called PyRel. 
The IR is derived from natural language queries related to a knowledge graph. 
You will use the IR along with similar properties or entity names identified by a FAISS vector database to format the final PyRel query. 
The natural language query is provided to help with context.

**Background**:

PyRel:
PyRel is a query language designed for querying knowledge graphs. 

Intermediate Representation (IR):
The IR represents the logical structure of the query, breaking down the natural language question into components that depict relationships and entities.

FAISS and Most Similar IDs:
FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. 
It is used to identify the most similar properties or entities in a knowledge graph based on vector representations. 
The "Most Similar IDs" list contains the most similar property or entity IDs in the knowledge graph for each component of the IR. 
For example, for an IR with two components, the list will have two dictionaries, each mapping similar property or entity IDs in the IR to the knowledge graph.

KG Schema in PyRel:
The schema for the knowledge graph is defined using `Triplet` type:

```
Triplet = graph.Type("Triplet")
with graph.rule():
    triplet = TripletsTable()
    Triplet.add(source_ent_id=triplet.source_ent_id, rid=triplet.rid, target_ent_id=triplet.target_ent_id)
```

To simplify the PyRel query, we built a Python wrapper class called clause to easily access (subject, property, object) triplets in the knowledge graph.

```
class clause:
    def __init__(self, relation_candidate_ids, subject_candidate_ids=None, object_candidate_ids=None):
        self.triple = Triple()
        self.triple.rid.in_(relation_candidate_ids)
        if subject_candidate_ids is not None:
            self.triple.source_ent_id.in_(subject_candidate_ids)
        if object_candidate_ids is not None:
            self.triple.target_ent_id.in_(object_candidate_ids)
            
    def get(self):
        return self.triple
```

**Examples:**

**Important Note.**
In order to correctly specify all the constraints in the PyRel query, especially if there are more than 3 clauses in the IR,
you should properly find ALL instances of matching variables in different clauses(e.g., if a variable appears in multiple conditions, ensure it is consistently referenced). 

**Instructions for Output:**  
Translate the following IR into PyRel. 
Provide the executable PyRel query only, without any code block markers (```), text, or comments before or after the query itself.
